HEADLINE_PROMPT = """\
Look at this traffic camera image and produce exactly two lines of output — nothing else.

Line 1: alert-style headline
Line 2: severity code

────────────────────────────────
LINE 1 — HEADLINE
────────────────────────────────
Format: [VEHICLE_PHRASE] detected responding to [INCIDENT_PHRASE]
INCIDENT_PHRASE must be singular — NEVER write "incidents" (plural).
Maximum 15 words.

VEHICLE_PHRASE rules (no numbers — use singular/plural only):
- Identify each distinct emergency vehicle type visible. For each type:
  - Police: marked patrol cars, police SUVs, highway patrol; vehicles with Battenburg checker pattern (yellow/blue, yellow/green, or yellow/lime) and "POLICE" markings or visible light bars — exactly 1 → "Police vehicle", 2 or more → "Police vehicles"
  - Fire trucks: fire engines, ladder trucks, heavy rescue — typically red or lime-green/yellow with emergency markings — exactly 1 → "Fire truck", 2 or more → "Fire trucks"
  - Ambulances: any of — box-body EMS/paramedic unit; vehicle with "AMBULANCE" text (often mirrored on hood); red cross or star-of-life markings; yellow-green or white emergency vehicle with EMS/paramedic livery; UK vehicles with yellow/green Battenburg checker pattern; vehicle with stretcher or medical equipment visible — exactly 1 → "Ambulance", 2 or more → "Ambulances"
  - Type unclear after applying the above: exactly 1 → "Emergency vehicle", 2 or more → "Emergency vehicles"
- Prefer a specific type over "Emergency vehicle" whenever features are partially visible; only use "Emergency vehicle" when you truly cannot distinguish.
- If multiple types are present, list them in order (Police, Fire truck, Ambulance, Emergency vehicle):
  - 2 types → join with "and": "Police vehicle and Fire truck"
  - 3+ types → use Oxford comma: "Police vehicle, Fire truck, and Ambulance"
- If NO emergency vehicles are visible → output "No emergency vehicles visible" (skip the detected responding format)
- "No incident visible" is ONLY for emergency vehicles that are clearly just driving past or patrolling with no scene present — e.g. a single police car passing through an empty intersection. If there is ANY stopped civilian vehicle, scene activity, damage, or workers present, use the appropriate incident type below.

INCIDENT_PHRASE rules:
- "crash" — use when physical crash evidence is visible: vehicle damage, deployed airbags, overturned vehicle, civilian vehicle stationary on grass/verge having left the roadway, ambulance(s) with stretchers beside a civilian vehicle, or multiple emergency vehicles stopped and clustered around a scene. Do NOT call it a crash from lights alone on an otherwise empty road.
- "fire" — flames or heavy smoke are visible
- "pulled-over vehicle" — police stopped behind or alongside a civilian vehicle on the shoulder or verge, even if lights are not clearly visible
- "blocked road" — a lane is physically blocked by cones, barriers, or wreckage. Use format: "Road blocked as [vehicle phrase lowercase] responds to emergency"
- "construction" — any active work zone: construction or utility machinery present (excavators, pavers, rollers, bucket/cherry picker trucks, aerial platform vehicles, cranes, tree work vehicles); workers in hi-vis vests on or beside the road; road work signs with active digging/resurfacing; OR a prominent layout of traffic cones or barriers delineating a work zone with workers or vehicles present
- "crowd" — a visible group of civilians gathered in or near the roadway
- If none of the above fit AND the vehicle is clearly just driving/patrolling with no scene → output "No incident visible".
- Never say "accident" or "collision" — use "crash"
- The word "incident" must NEVER appear in Line 1 under any circumstances.

The ONLY valid Line 1 outputs are:
  [VEHICLE_PHRASE] detected responding to crash
  [VEHICLE_PHRASE] detected responding to fire
  [VEHICLE_PHRASE] detected responding to pulled-over vehicle
  [VEHICLE_PHRASE] detected responding to construction
  [VEHICLE_PHRASE] detected responding to crowd
  Road blocked as [vehicle phrase] responds to emergency
  No emergency vehicles visible
  No incident visible

Do NOT mention location, time of day, weather, road names, or road type.
Do NOT use subjective descriptions (e.g. "major", "serious", "quiet", "busy").
Do NOT include vehicle counts as numbers.
Do NOT use "incidents" (plural) — always use "incident" (singular).

────────────────────────────────
LINE 2 — SEVERITY
────────────────────────────────
Output exactly one of these two codes:

Count ALL emergency vehicles visible in the image (police cars, fire trucks, ambulances — any type).

general.alert2.local  — 3 or more emergency vehicles visible
general.alert3        — 0, 1, or 2 emergency vehicles visible

When in doubt, choose general.alert3.

────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT (exactly two lines, no labels, no blank lines):
Police vehicles and Fire truck detected responding to crash
general.alert2.local

Another example:
Police vehicle detected responding to pulled-over vehicle
general.alert3

Another example (no clear incident):
No incident visible
